## 2.1.0 - 2021-11-04

### Added

- Published protobuf definitions from:
    ```
    tag: oss-v21.10.0
    commit: 076363440415a834a5d282aed556438cdcc6d434
    ```
    - This update adds a ServerFeatures protobuf a client may use to determine
      the available capabilities of the server with respect to new gRPC
      interface features
    - The `ReadReq` streams message has added an option to receive a trailing
      `ReadResp` message with the first and last stream position in the stream
      being read.

## 2.0.0 - 2021-07-03

### Changed

- Published protobuf definitions from:
    ```
    tag: oss-v21.6.0
    commit: 1f713a407019b8f441aaa29110b57a7d4cd35c10
    ```

This tag presents new changes for the protobufs:

- (breaking) the stream_identifier shared type's `streamName` field has been
  renamed to `stream_name`
- a new batch-append rpc has been added to the streams API
- persistent subscriptions can be configured to subscribe to the magic `$all`
  stream

These stream-name casing change is the only breaking change. It presents a
difference in how users of this library must integrate with the gpb-generated
records, but it is not a noticeable difference in the over-the-wire encoding
between the client and server. A consumer updating to the v2 of this library
must update its usage of the gpb-generated records, but is compatible with
EventStoreDB v20.6.0-v21.6.0
